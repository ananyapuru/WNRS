# We're Not Really Strangers

**Note:** This project is a personal adaptation of the game "We're Not Really Strangers." I do not own the license to the original game, and this adaptation is for personal local usage only. 
As a result, it is not hosted publicly online, nor is it meant to be.

## Project Description

This Java project represents my first independent endeavor in software development. It is a personal adaptation of the widely popular card game "We're Not Really Strangers." The adaptation is designed for local usage and provides an engaging, interactive experience for players on their computers.

## Technical Details

The project showcases my introductory proficiency in Java programming and leverages the power of the Swing library to create a polished graphical user interface. Swing is a versatile Java library that facilitates the creation of windows, buttons, and interactive elements, resulting in a seamless user experience.

Key technical aspects of this project include:
- Utilization of Java programming language for application logic.
- Integration of Swing APIs to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
- Implementation of event-driven programming for user interaction.
- Careful consideration of user experience design principles to ensure an enjoyable gaming experience.
